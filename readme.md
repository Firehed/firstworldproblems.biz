Thanks for your interest in contributing to firstworldproblems!

Just to set expectations, our goals are the following:

* Provide some entertaining commentary on the startup world
* Link out to some actually-useful services (just because a problem is first-world doesn't mean it's not a problem!)
* Keep the site extremely low-overhead: no server-side languages or external dependencies

If you have suggestions for other sites, please submit a pull request! However, we're not really looking for major UI changes at this time - for example, the unnecessary redirect delay is very much intentional.
